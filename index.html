          I am currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.champlainonline.com/champlainweb/">Champlain Regional College</a>, an English CEGEP located in St-Lambert, Quebec.
          It is currently my second year there, however it is my first year in the Computer Science and Technology program.
          <br>
          This three-year career program is designed to provide us with all the required tools to enter the job market right after CEGEP (unlike pre-university programs).
          Despite this, I would very much like to continue into higher education, preferably at <a href="https://www.etsmtl.ca/">ÉTS</a> (<i>École de Technologie Supérieur</i>).
          <br>
          I chose this program since I am a naturally very tech-savvy person. I enjoy using and exploring open-source alternatives to proprietary software, building my own desktops and servers as well as building and designing websites.

          Throughout my high school and CEGEP education, I've been a part of the Canadian Robotics Competition (CRC). Although the event is centered around robots completing unique 
          challenges, my job was to design and develop simple websites to showcase our teams, robot and the competition itself. My latest site was for my high school, Centennial Regional 
          High School (CRHS) for the 2020 competition (unfortunately, due to the situation with COVID, I was unable to complete the 2021 and 2022 competitions with my team).
          <br>
          I'm happy to say I've learned a lot throughout the years, and this last site I made with CRHS both helped me test out my previous knowledge while also giving me new challenges 
          that I have discovered.
          <br>
          <small>The site is not available publicly through its own domain, as my high school has since taken down the site for the robotics.</small>

          During my first semester of the Computer Science and Technology program, I was instructed to build a site week-by-week,
          learning web development and design concepts. The site, however, does not have a design that fits within modern design
          philosophies and best practices.
          <br>
          For my portfolio site, I decided to make something clean, simple and with more animations and interactivity. Using
          Javascript was also useful in creating a more user-friendly responsive design (like a toggleable dropdown).
